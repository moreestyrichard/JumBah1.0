        <h2>Geography</h2>
        <p>
          Located on the northern part of the island of Borneo, Sabah is the
          second largest state in Malaysia. It shares a border with Sarawak to
          the southwest and Kalimantan, Indonesia to the south. Sabah's
          coastline is washed by the South China, Sulu, and Celebes seas. The
          state's landscape is a mix of mountainous regions, coastal plains, and
          lush tropical rainforests. The Crocker Range, running through the
          heart of Sabah, is home to Mount Kinabalu, the highest peak in
          Malaysia and Southeast Asia, standing at 4,095 meters. The
          Kinabatangan River, the longest in Sabah, flows from the Crocker Range
          to the Sulu Sea.

        <h2>Area and Climate</h2>
        <p>
          Sabah covers an area of approximately 73,619 square kilometers. It
          enjoys a warm tropical climate with temperatures generally ranging
          from 23°C to 32°C. Known as the "Land Below the Wind," Sabah is
          situated south of the typhoon belt, making it generally free from
          major climatic disturbances. The state experiences a wet season from
          November to April and a drier season from May to October, although
          rainfall is common year-round.

        <h2>History and Economy</h2>
        <p>
          Sabah's history dates back over 20,000 years, with evidence of early
          human settlements. Before the 15th century, it was influenced by the
          Srivijaya and Majapahit empires. Later, it became part of the
          Sultanates of Brunei and Sulu. In the late 19th century, the British
          North Borneo Company was established, and the territory became a
          British protectorate. After World War II, it became a British Crown
          Colony. On September 16, 1963, Sabah joined with Malaya, Sarawak, and
          Singapore to form the Federation of Malaysia. Sabah's economy has
          traditionally been reliant on the export of natural resources. Today,
          its key economic sectors are agriculture (especially palm oil),
          tourism, and manufacturing. Eco-tourism is a major contributor, with
          attractions like Mount Kinabalu, Sipadan Island, and numerous wildlife
          conservation areas.

        <p>
          Sabah is a vibrant multicultural state with over 30 different ethnic
          groups and more than 80 local dialects. The largest indigenous groups

          Chinese population. The total population of Sabah is estimated to be
          around 3.4 million people. This cultural diversity is reflected in the
          state's unique blend of traditions, festivals, languages, and food.
          The Kaamatan Harvest Festival, celebrated by the Kadazan-Dusun, is one
          of the most significant cultural events in Sabah.
